## Kincyclopedia:Software Group Development Project
Kincyclopedia was developed by a group of five students part of the MSc Bioinformatics course from the Queen Mary's University of London, under the supervision of Prof Conrad Bessant and Dr Fabrizio Smeraldi.

All the search functions in the website were linked to a database, which contained kinases, inhibitors and phosphosites information. This information was used to produce a report card for the search string given by the user. An important feature apart from the search function is the phosphoproteomics data analysis tool, which produces a result in three categories bar plot representing the relative kinase activity and relative inhibited kinase activity, volcano plot for the complete protein and a volcano plot for all the identified kinases. All the files which were used to these plots can be downloaded for further use.
